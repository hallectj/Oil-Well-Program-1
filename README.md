# Oil-Well-Program-1
This program is to simulate oil wells and getting sensory inputs from the sensors.  Obviously these aren't real wells and sensors so the sensors simply obtain a random number to simulate reading from a sensor.

This was a project I did in my Object Oriented C++ course at the university, done on Visual Studio 2012.  In the end there will be 2 respositories, one for program 1 and another for program 2.  I have program 2 finished but won't upload until after the semester is over with.

Once you download the file, you will open it up in Visual Studio and run it.  The console will prompt you with a file name.  You will type in the oil parser which is "OilXMLFile.xml"  Then follow the prompts.  You can add and remove oil wells and sensors.  This project was done to test our knowledge of Object Oriented Design concepts.  A better version will be uploaded once the semester is complete (it's already done) which involves deeper object oriented concepts and design patterns, namely the strategy pattern and simple factory patterns, so be on the look out for version 2 shortly.
